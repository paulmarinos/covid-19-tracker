# covid-19 U.S. tracker

view covid-19 statistics by either U.S. state or date and perform simple linear regression analysis.


## Datasource (updated daily):

https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-states.csv


## Libraries used:

- pandas for data preparation
- numpy for data manipulation
- matplotlib for data visualization
- sklearn for statistical modeling


## Objectives:Â 

- Analyze the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths by U.S. state over time
- Calculate COVID-19 mortality rate by state
- Create a tool that will quickly visualize the data using tables and charts
- Allow user to search by either state or date and sort data by columns
- Allow user to plot the data and fit a linear regression model
- Calculate R-squared value


## R-squared value:

The Rsquared value, or correlation of determination, explains how closely correlated the dependent value (cases) is with the independent value (deaths).
